Credit card fraud detection is a process that involves using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and prevent fraudulent activities related to credit card transactions. It analyzes various data points, such as transaction history, customer behavior patterns, and geographic location, to detect suspicious activities and potential fraud.

The system typically employs a combination of rule-based systems and anomaly detection algorithms to flag unusual or fraudulent transactions. These algorithms learn from historical data and continuously adapt to new fraud patterns to improve accuracy.

When a potentially fraudulent transaction is detected, the system may trigger an alert or block the transaction in real-time. Fraud detection models are often trained on large datasets containing both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions to ensure high precision and recall rates.

Key indicators that may raise suspicion include sudden large transactions, multiple failed transaction attempts, international transactions without prior indication of travel, or unusual purchasing patterns. By leveraging sophisticated fraud detection techniques, financial institutions can minimize losses and protect their customers from unauthorized card usage.
